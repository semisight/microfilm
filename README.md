###See what happened to you a long time ago...
#####Things you wanted to forget but facebook won't let you.

Go to empty-autumn-8340.herokuapp.com, and follow the instructions.

Ever wanted to see what was important 3 years ago? To see the things fate has long since wovenâ€¦. Well, I hadn't, but you have to admit, it's kinda cool. Once you've logged in, you'll be able to enter a date (in /month/day/full year) after the url, and you'll be able to see what life was like way back 17 months ago.

PS: Try to break the app all you want, but please be nice; I haven't been able to make this as robust as possible.

This is a weekend project. Like it? Contribute! (You'll be my bestest friend :D).
